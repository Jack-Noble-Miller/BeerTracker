--DATABASE CREDENTIALS HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR SECURITY--

An app to track alcohol consumption, that allows:
-A user to add drinks they have drank
-A user to create new drinks if not present in the database
-A user to view their drink history
-A user to have an overview of their top 3 drink types
-A user to be able to view a leaderboard to compare to other users

It supports different drink types such as
-Beer
-Spirits
-Cider
-Cocktails
-Wine

This app is intended for a small group of users(not available to public), this is why database transactions are handled locally.
